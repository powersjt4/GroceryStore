*The Grocery Store *				
*##################*
You have been tasked with getting all of the items on the shopping list. There 
are a  few different departments. It is not clear where all these items are 
but they should be pretty intuitive. Some might be more difficult. 
*Hint* Go to the meat department twice.

The goal is to select either a basket or a shopping cart get all of the items on the
shopping list  and then choose the quickest checkout line. 
You must complete this in a certain number of moves. Who knows what could happen 
to slow you down.
